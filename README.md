The project is based on detecting anomalies in weather patterns and predicting the next day's temperature.
Data is collected from an USA based weather forecasting website called the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA)
The 'processedweather(1).csv' file consists of the data that is collected and preprocessed
The 'Data cleaning' file uses functions to preprocess the data by removing duplicate and repeated values and filling up the null values. 
"Data visualization" is used to generated various graphs of the data. 
"Anomaly-isolation-forest(1)" is used to do the anomaly detection using unsupervised methods. 
"Ridge regression" is used as a prediction model for the weather data.
